<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how I collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with my website.</p>

    <h3>What personal information do I collect from the people that visit my website?</h3>

       <p>When contacting me through my contact form, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address or other details to help you with your experience.</p>

    <h3>When do I collect information?</h3>

        <p>I collect information from you when you fill out a form or enter information on my site.</p>

        <p>Other non-personal information is collected about you when you enter the website so I can better understand how people use my website through the use of cookies (please read further for a more detailed description of the site's use of cookies).</p>

    <h3>How do I use your information?</h3>

        <p> I may use the information I collect from you when you use certain site features, such as the contact form, to follow up with correspondance or inquiries.</p>

    <h3>How do I protect your information?</h3>

        <p>I use regular vulnerability and malware scanning on the website and never ask for credit card or other sensitive personal information.</p>

        <p>Any personal information that is collected is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by the webmaster(s) who has/have special security clearance to such systems, and are required to keep all information confidential. In addition, all sensitive information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</p>

        <p>I implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p>

        <p>I do not process or initiate any transactions, therefore no information is stored or processed on our servers.</p>

    <h3>Do I use cookies?</h3>

        <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, I use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that I can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. I also use trusted third-party services that track this information on my behalf.</p>

        <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since each browser is a little different, look at your browser's help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>

        <p>If you turn cookies off, some of the features that make your site experience more efficient may not function properly.</p>

    <h3>Third-party disclosure</h3>

        <p>I do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your PPI unless I provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. I may also release information when it's release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect my or others' rights, property or safety.</p>

        <p>However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>

    <h3>Third-party links</h3>

        <p>Occasionally, at my discretion, I may include or offer third-party products or services on my website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. I therefore accept no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, I seek to protect the integrity of my site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>

    <h3>Google</h3>

        <p>I do not Google AdSense Advertising on our website, however I do use Google Analytics to track site traffic. Information sent to Google can include information used to track individual user behavior on the website. However, NO personal information, such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or addresses, will be sent or used to personally identify a single user.</p>

        <p>Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to track users on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to track users based on previous visits to my site and other sites on the internet. Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad and Content Network privacy policy.</p>

        <p>I have implemented demographics and interests reporting, as well as user tracking on my website.</p>

        <p>I, along with third-party vendors such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to my website.</p>

        <h4>Opting out:</h4>

            <p>Users can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Settings page. Alternatively, you can opt out by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative Opt Out page or by using the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser add on.</p>

    <h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>

        <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>

        <p>Due to the nature of the website, this website <em>does not</em> need to be CalOPPA compliant, and therefore is <em>not</em> fully compliant. However, I have taken steps to ensure I protect user privacy by implementing the following.</p>

        <h4>According to CalOPPA, I agree to the following:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Users can visit my site anonymously.</li>
                <li>This privacy policy is linked on my home page.</li>
                <li>My privacy policy link includes the word 'privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.</li>
                <li>You will be notified of any privacy policy changes on the privacy policy page.</li>
                <li>You can edit any personal information you provide to use by emailing me at matt@mattajones.com.</li>
           </ul>

    <h3>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h3>

        <p>I honor Do Not Track signals and do not track or plant cookies when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>

    <h3>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h3>

        <p>I allow third-party behavioral tracking from services such as Google Analytics.</p>

    <h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>

        <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>

        <p>I do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old. However, I do allow third-parties, including stie traffic tracking services, to collect PII from children under 13.</p>

    <h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>

        <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

        <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices I will notify users via email and an in-site notification within 7 business days the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>

        <p>I agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>

    <h3>CAN SPAM Act</h3>

        <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

        <p>I collect your email address in order to send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</p>

        <p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, I agree to not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses and identify any advertisements in some reasonable way.</p>

        <p><strong>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email me and I will promptly remove you from further correspondence.</strong></p>

    <h3>Contacting Me</h3>

        <p>If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy, you may contact me at https://mattajones.com/contact.html or <strong>matt@mattajones.com</strong>.</p>
